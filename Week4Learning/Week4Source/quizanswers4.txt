1- It's a machine learning example, it's not unsupervised because you give them images
that you know for sure belong to a person, supervised makes the most sense, given a 
test set (images that you know are of a person) test new images with that person's face
to see if they are recognized as being that person.

2-Imagine a regression AI that makes the following predictions for the following 5 data points. 
What is the total L2 loss across all of these data points 
(i.e., the sum of all the individual L2 losses for each data point)?
*
For data point 1, the true output is 2 and the AI predicted 4. 
For data point 2, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 5.
For data point 3, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 3.
For data point 4, the true output is 5 and the AI predicted 2.
For data point 5, the true output is 6 and the AI predicted 5.

We have that L2 loss function is: L(actual, predicted) = (actual - predicted)²
point1 = (2-4)² = 4
point2 = (4-5)² = 1
point3 = (4-3)² = 1
point4 = (5-2)² = 9
point5 = (6-5)² = 1
Total loss = 16

3- Hypothesis1 L1 loss = |4-3| = 1
   Hypothesis1 L2 loss = (4-3)² = 1
   Hypothesis1 L1 loss = |4-2| = 2
   Hypothesis1 L2 loss = (4-2)² = 4
   
  1- This makes the most sense, as said, loss functions can be a double edged sword.
  2- No.
  3- This doesn't make sense.
  4- No.
  5- No.

4- 0
